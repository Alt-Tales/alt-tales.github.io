Recently, he stumbled upon concepts of tabletop, and tried to be a DM, and he found out that he had a lot of fun making stories and giving options to his players that would directly change the flow of his story. Because of this, he had a sudden inspiration, to make more alternative ways for stories to be told... He asked the help from Kimcchirific, a starting freelance comic artist, to come up with a plan on they can make new ways in telling stories...  The pair of creators did some research and find the cheapest ways to publish their ideas on the internet. This gave birth to Alt_Tales, an open source website hosted for free on github pages. On September 9, they published the bare foundation of the site... With just a logo, and some text, the duo began to fill in more and more content on each update....",
